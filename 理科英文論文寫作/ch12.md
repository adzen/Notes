12.1 使語意明確的字彙

使句子間的連結關係更加清楚

3. 傾向
  * increased, decreased, became larger, became smaller, became better, became worse
4. 絕對狀態

5. 添加

6. 舉例

7. 反對或替代方案
  * but, or, however, on the contrary, in contrast, on the other hand
8. 闡述結論

12.2 避免意義不明確的字彙

* ... became **very** hot. （有多熱？）
* ... were **relatively** small. （有多小？）

應該注意的字彙：
very, quite, rarely, seldom, infrequently, once in a while, unlikely, usually, likely, almost certain, tended to be, was often, moderately, relatively

12.3 容易用錯的字彙

amount

**A large amount of grams** of the sample was...（錯誤）→ **A large amount of the sample** was...（正確）→ **The sample (500 g)** was...（優）

句子不要以阿拉伯數字作開頭
**500 g** of... → **Five hundred grams** of...

only

only 在句子中不同的放置位置會有不同的意義。

it

使用 it 時，應讓讀者明確得知 it 為何物。

varing & various

兩字意思有差別，小心別誤用。
varing = changing（不停變化的）
various = different（不同的）

that & which

The crystals that were blue were...（有各種顏色的結晶）
The crystals, which were blue, were...（只有藍色的結晶）

and/or

建議不要頻繁使用。讀者需花力氣推測作者的意圖，假設所有可能性。

case 

* in this case → here
* in most cases → usually（若能明確指出頻率會更好）
* in all cases → always
* in no case → never

propose & develop(ed)

propose：充分考量某個想法後提案
develop(ed)：任務結束後

12.4 用字力求簡潔明確

1. 贅字及艱深的字彙

check into, later on, climb up, link up, close down, open up, divide up, seal off, end up, weigh out, enter into, write up, in between

climb 理所當然會 up，所以 up 是不需要的（雖然跟日常會話的習慣不太一樣）

過於冗長的片語可用簡單的字替換

it is clear that → clearly
by means of → by

替換成較簡單的字彙或片語

utilize → use
perform → do
prior to → before

2. 同義詞重複

* merged together → merged
* complete full → full

3. 最高級形容詞

* very unique → unique
* very impossible → impossible
不過 nearly straight 是對的

一些擁有最高級意義的單字

dead, obvious, perfect, permant, safe, vertical, horizontal, flat
